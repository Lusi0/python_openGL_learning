HOLY SHOOT COLLISION DETECTION WORKS!!!!!

i guess now i can do other stuff with it???

it summons stuff on interactions


READ ME UPDATES: 12/15/2021

I have made a "functional" physics engine that I will use for the time being, I am still working of implimenting collision detectiion

I am working on making a player object and I have already created a physics object

I think that most of the stuff in the game is going to end up being based on rectangles as they are very easy to work with, I might change my mind on this if it becomes apparent that alternative solutions are more effective/efficient for my purposes.

Movement is now working properly! i can move the square around and there is no artifacts and the screen doesn't keep the old drawing there!

this was achieved using the 

glClearColor()

glClear()

fuctions which together set the color of the backround and then clear the screen.

more of the stuff from main_old.py is not my code by the object definition from main_new.py is mine but main_new.py hardly works as intended for right now.

Currently I am moving the square on the screen but I am having some issues with drawing multiple copies of it and sometimes having it disappear every other frame.

Progress none the less

list of stuff that I don't know how it works:

glTranslate()

list of stuff I sort of understand:

gluPerspective()
pygame.display.flip()

list of stuff I totally get

glClearColor()

glClear()

class square (i wrote it of course i know what it does)
