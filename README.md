Movement is now working properly! i can move the square around and there is no artifacts and the screen doesn't keep the old drawing there!

this was achieved using the 

glClearColor()

glClear()

fuctions which together set the color of the backround and then clear the screen.


READ ME UPDATES: 12/13/2021

more of the stuff from main_old.py is not my code by the object definition from main_new.py is mine but main_new.py hardly works as intended for right now.

Currently I am moving the square on the screen but I am having some issues with drawing multiple copies of it and sometimes having it disappear every other frame.

Progress none the less

list of stuff that I don't know how it works:

glTranslate()

list of stuff I sort of understand:

gluPerspective()
pygame.display.flip()

list of stuff I totally get

glClearColor()

glClear()

class square (i wrote it of course i know what it does)
