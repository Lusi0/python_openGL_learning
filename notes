# gluPerspective(fovy, aspect, znear, zfar)

# fovy (float)
Specifies the field of view angle, in degrees, in the y direction.

# aspect (float)
Specifies the aspect ratio that determines the field of view in the x direction. The aspect ratio is the ratio of x (width) to y (height).

# zNear (float)
Specifies the distance from the viewer to the near clipping plane (always positive).

# zFar (float)
Specifies the distance from the viewer to the far clipping plane (always positive).
